## Comment Annotations

* <a name="annotate-above"></a>
  Annotations should usually be written on the line immediately above the
  relevant code.
<sup>[[link](#annotate-above)]</sup>

* <a name="annotate-keywords"></a>
  The annotation keyword is followed by a colon and a space, then a note
  describing the problem.
<sup>[[link](#annotate-keywords)]</sup>

* <a name="rare-eol-annotations"></a>
  In cases where the problem is so obvious that any documentation would be
  redundant, annotations may be left at the end of the offending line with no
  note. This usage should be the exception and not the rule.

  ```Ruby
  def bar
    sleep 100 # OPTIMIZE
  end
  ```

* <a name="todo"></a>
  Use `TODO` to note missing features or functionality that should be added at
  a later date.
<sup>[[link](#todo)]</sup>

* <a name="fixme"></a>
  Use `FIXME` to note broken code that needs to be fixed.
<sup>[[link](#fixme)]</sup>

* <a name="optimize"></a>
  Use `OPTIMIZE` to note slow or inefficient code that may cause performance
  problems.
<sup>[[link](#optimize)]</sup>

* <a name="hack"></a>
  Use `HACK` to note code smells where questionable coding practices were used
  and should be refactored away.
<sup>[[link](#hack)]</sup>

* <a name="review"></a>
  Use `REVIEW` to note anything that should be looked at to confirm it is
  working as intended. For example: `REVIEW: Are we sure this is how the client
  does X currently?`

* <a name="document-annotations"></a>
  Use other custom annotation keywords if it feels appropriate, but be sure to
  document them in your project's `README` or similar.
