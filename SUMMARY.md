# Our Ruby Style Guide

This style guide is a minor refinement of [bbatsov's amazing work](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).  In some places we are more opinionated.  In others we are less.  Likely the biggest difference between the two guides is that we are fans of using some simple conventions to add hints of intent for the readers of our code.
